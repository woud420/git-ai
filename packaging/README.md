# Git AI packaging

This directory contains MSI and PKG installer scaffolding for Git AI.

Package outputs must install `git-ai` only. They must not install a `git`
wrapper, `git.exe` shim, `git-og`, or any other executable that changes Git
command routing. Per-user trace2 and editor/agent setup remains the
responsibility of `git-ai install-hooks`.

The release workflow builds signed/notarized production packages when the
required Apple and Azure signing secrets are configured. Dry-run releases can
build unsigned packages for validation. macOS releases include Intel, Apple
Silicon, and universal PKGs.

The Windows MSI is per-user: it installs under
`%USERPROFILE%\\.git-ai\\bin` and changes only that user's `PATH`. It has no
all-users or Administrator install mode. The macOS PKG copies its bundled
binary into the active console user's `~/.git-ai/bin`, then runs setup as that
user. It fails if no valid console user is logged in or per-user setup fails.

For an enterprise endpoint, pass configuration to the MSI when installing:

```powershell
msiexec /i git-ai-windows-x64.msi API_BASE=https://usegitai.com API_KEY=your-api-key
```

These values configure only the installing user's Git AI config. They are
hidden from MSI logs, but command-line arguments can still be visible to local
process inspection and shell history. Use your endpoint-management secret
mechanism when available.

When `install.sh` runs inside WSL, it installs the Linux binary as usual and
also hands the matching release MSI to the Windows host. The handoff requires
working Windows interoperability (`cmd.exe`, `wslpath`, and `msiexec.exe`),
stages the MSI under the resolved Windows user's temporary directory, and
skips the host installation when that user's `git-ai.exe` already exists.
Native Linux and macOS installs never enter this path. Host failures report
only the failed prerequisite or installer exit code; configuration values are
not included in diagnostics.
