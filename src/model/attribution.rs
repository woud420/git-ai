//! Core attribution types.
//!
//! `Attribution` and `LineAttribution` are the public data model for attribution
//! ranges. They are pure value types (character- and line-level authorship
//! ranges) shared by the attribution tracker, working logs, and virtual
//! attribution, so they live in `model` rather than up in `operations`.

/// Represents a single attribution range in the file.
/// Ranges can overlap (multiple authors can be attributed to the same text).
